          Unfortunately I was hospitalized for emergency surgency right as the previous season was ending so I was unable to transition to the new season.
          During this time, rep and jam were in a hard spot and were forced to look for a new developer since I was not in communication.
          No hard feelings on either side and I would have done the same in their position.
          With a new developer working on this, a new vitalityx queue system will soon be in place, so it doesn't make sense for me to keep working on it and this current site will be shutting down.

          Thanks to everyone for being a part of this project while I was around.
          <br/><br />
          Best,
          <br/>
